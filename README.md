# Malmö — Sink : a listening experience

https://sink.hej-malmo.se

The dreaminess and raw melancholy of Malmö's four musical pieces combines with Arthur Redler's deeply naturals monochrome photographs for an introspective escape through wilderness natural sites of United States west coast.

This complete experience appeals to several senses, bringing the listener closer to the original inspiration of the musician.
